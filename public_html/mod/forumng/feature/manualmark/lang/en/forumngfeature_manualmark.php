As soon as you view a discussion, it is marked read;
if you view it again, there will be no unread posts.

In manual mode, by contrast, messages continue to be displayed as unread until you click
<strong>Mark discussion read</strong> in the discussion, or
use equivalent options on the main forum page.

The option works across all forums on the system.';
